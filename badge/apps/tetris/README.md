## Gameplay

The objective is to complete horizontal lines by rotating and positioning falling tetrominoes. When a line is completed, it clears and you earn points. The game speeds up as you progress through levels. The game ends when pieces can no longer spawn at the top.

Level increases every 10 lines cleared, making the pieces fall faster!
